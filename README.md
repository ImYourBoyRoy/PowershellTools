## 🚀 Welcome to the Toolbox!

Greetings, PowerShell enthusiasts and curious coders! You've just stumbled upon a treasure trove of PowerShell wizardry. I've been crafting these tools for years, and now it's time to share the magic with the world. Whether you're managing corporate infrastructure or tinkering with personal projects, there's something here for everyone!

## 🧙‍♂️ What's in the Box?

This toolbox is packed with a variety of PowerShell tools for both corporate and personal projects. It's like Mary Poppins' bag, but for IT pros and hobbyists!

- 🏢 **Corporate Tools**: Streamline your business processes
- 🏠 **Personal Projects**: Automate your home lab or personal tasks

## ⚡ Quick Start

Before diving into the toolbox, make sure you're equipped with the latest PowerShell. Run this command in your terminal to get started:

This will ensure you're using PowerShell 7 or later, which is what these tools are optimized for.
